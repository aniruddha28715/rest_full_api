 (this 1, 2 we gotta make it dynamic so...)
 DYNAMIC PATH PARAMETERS
 -->GET /api/user/:id    //`:` makes in Dynamic

...now here we have a problem cuz html browser takes only get requests by default
not the below ones.. so now lets make a routes...

POST /api/user - create new user

PATCH /api/user/1 - edit the user with ID 1

DELETE /api/user/1 - delete the user with ID 1

//for all this we will need postman applicaiton setup 
// so that we can perform these methods
